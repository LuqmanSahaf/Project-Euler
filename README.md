# Solve-Project-Euler
This project presents solutions for mathematics problems at [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) in different languages.

I use this project to learn new languages. Forgive me if I do not come up with best programming practices in any language. Since Project Euler presents mathematical problems, the solutions mostly will be of functional nature. So, the choice for languages (Haskell, Rust, Go, Scala).

I am no mathematician, but love to solve problems in efficient ways. The goal is to come up with efficient ways which involve mathematical analysis and solutions. I might not be able to present perfect or fully optimized solutions for every problem. I will be happy to get feedback from anyone about my solutions and also inefficient code.

### Thanks
I would like to thank [James Somers](http://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-somers) for writing [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/?single_page=true) article, in which he describes how he failed, and learned how to code. I got my introduction to Project Euler in this article and it was great.

## Note
The purpose of _original_ Project Euler is to make you think for the solution (preferably elegant). Thinking and devising solutions on your own is strongly advised.
